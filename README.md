# Stormchaser - Front End for OpenAg

This application provides the web interface for the OpenAg API and model.
It is currently copyright Regents of the University of California, though
we are exploring additional licensing options.

Documentation on using the application can be found at https://openag-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run dev
```
We use Vite for bundling and building - this will run Vite in an environment
that makes the application live in the browser so changes are shown automatically.

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
You can generate a build into the dist folder with this command, but in practice,
this isn't how we handle this process. See the OpenAg_Admin_Docs repo for more
details on how production deployments happen.
